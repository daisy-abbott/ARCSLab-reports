# Activities 
* W&B Course
    * lesson one: Building an end to end prototype
        * goal: recognize what's in front of car (self driving)
        * exploratory data analysis: weights and bias tables
        * Split data into train, validation and test, then trained the baseline model
        * communicate results in reports
        * Started following along: https://github.com/daisy-abbott/ARCSLab-reports/blob/master/Assets/MLOPSnotebook1.ipynb

    * Lesson two: Moving beyond the baseline
        * Can refactor baseline to improve results (re-organize code)
        * can move notebook to a .py file and then run through terminal
            * can see runs in workspace
        * --help shows all the parameters you are capable of overriding 
        * can adjust batch size: --batch_size 16
        * IOU = intersection over union
        * Add sweep configuation file to adjust hyper paremeters
        * Can run on multiple GPU's and reduce time performing the sweep 




* Sweet Home Staircases: 
    * Cannot easily add in staircases or inclines to existing models.

    * Must Add another elevation. Plan -> add level. Then import original background image with the same origin and dimensions. Then can right click on level -> modify level -> adjust elevation to bring it down.

    * This possibly isn't a great place to put the stairs, not a lot of room with what we are working with.

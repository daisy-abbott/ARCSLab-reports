# Activities 
* W&B Course
    * lesson one: Building an end to end prototype
        * goal: recognize what's in front of car (self driving)
        * exploratory data analysis: weights and bias tables
        * Split data into train, validation and test, then trained the baseline model
        * communicate results in reports
        * Started following along: https://github.com/daisy-abbott/ARCSLab-reports/blob/master/Assets/MLOPSnotebook1.ipynb


* Sweet Home Staircases: 
    * Cannot easily add in staircases or inclines to existing models.

    * Must Add another elevation. Plan -> add level. Then import original background image with the same origin and dimensions. Then can right click on level -> modify level -> adjust elevation to bring it down.

    * This possibly isn't a great place to put the stairs, not a lot of room with what we are working with.

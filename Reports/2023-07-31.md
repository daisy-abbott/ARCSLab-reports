# Activites
# Exporting the Model
* Tried to implement Christy's suggestion of removing the callback function before we export it: 
* ```  # Save trained model
    torch.save(net, modelname)
    
    # Remove callback function
    learn.remove_cb(CSVLogger)
    
    # export model 
    learn.export(modelname)```
* worked once: 
* `Model relative filename : artifacts/07-26_wandering_10Trials_randomized:v0/data/cmd_models_fixed/classification-resnet18-pretrained-0.pkl
Model relative filename : artifacts/07-26_wandering_10Trials_randomized:v0/data/cmd_models_fixed/classification-resnet18-pretrained-1.pkl
wandb: Waiting for W&B process to finish... (success).`

* Running into an error: 
* ``` Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/dcad2021/cur-imgcmd.py", line 300, in <module>

    loaders = [dl.new(dl.dataset.new_empty()) for dl in self.loaders]
AttributeError: 'ImageWithCmdDataset' object has no attribute 'new_empty'

* Tried multiple things to solve but the most successful was removeing learn.export because by calling the export method on the Learner object, it tries to create a new DataLoader using the new_empty method.But the ImageWithCmdDataset class does not have this method, leading to the AttributeError.
* ```
    torch.save(net.state_dict(), modelname)  # Save only the model's state_dict
    
    # Remove callback function
    learn.remove_cb(CSVLogger)
* Will this work in the same way as exporting? I think that it should because it saves the trained model's parameters, and we can later load them back when we need to use the model for predictions or further training.

# Documenting img+cmd
* Link to documented img command code: https://github.com/daisy-abbott/ARCSLab-reports/blob/master/Assets/cur-imgcmd001.py
* Need more at top? Is it fine that the docstring is below imports? 
# Poster
* Looked at Pomona's Poster info and examples: https://www.pomona.edu/academics/departments/psychological-science/research-instructional-resources/presentations-conferences
* Looked into using Canva: https://www.canva.com/posters/templates/ 
* Notes From Video: 

# Poster Format
* Title: Something involving: Autonomous Navigation (research question?)
* Introduction: 
  * Recently virtual simulation environments have become increasingly popular because training physical robots in the real world can be expensive and tedious (during training robots will make mistakes and run into walls and become damaged) as well as contain less dynamic datasets. In V.S. it's easier to manipulate the environment to create a diverse datset of images captured at all times of day, with all kinds of textures. 
* Method: 
  * Modeled Oldenborg using Unreal, SweetHome3d, and blender. (Experimented with several architecturing application and found the Unreal was best suited for our purposes)
  * Collected a dataset using Boxnav, wanding and perfect 
  * Refined a script training a CNN model using a current image plus it's previous command 

* Results: 
  * Include a metric showing the increased acuracy when using the image + command 
  * Include the epoch accuracy increase
  * Maybe implement some of Chrity's code suggestions to inferency.py to include more metrics? 

* Discussion Section
  * Next steps? Limitations? 
# Poster Format Instructions
* Fonts
  * Sans serif fonts for titles
  * Serif fonts for text
* Font sizes 24-28 for main text
* White background (save the earth!)
* Use the same margins, align them
* Max width: 48"
* max length: 36"
# Alternative Poster Style
* Main finding: Need to know (not just nice to know)
  * (probably our biggest finding was the increase in acuracy when using the combination of image and previous command)
* then all the regular poster stuff on a side bar
* link to example poster: https://osf.io/6ua4k
* QR Code with link to something? Github, Presentation? Idks

# Main Finding for Alternative Poster Design
* img + cmd
  * Training a NN using the current image captured by the agent combined with the previous command given to the agent lead to a significant increase in accuracy.
  * Randomization in Unreal 
# Example Format: 
* <img width="349" alt="Screenshot 2023-08-03 at 11 59 43 AM" src="https://github.com/daisy-abbott/ARCSLab-reports/assets/112681549/747e502d-842b-466d-b9e4-326c4d08ba5c">

# Process:
* Tried in Canva, but without premium version, very limited.
* Tried in Word, not super easy to use
* Going with PowerPoint

# Activites
# Exporting the Model
* Tried to implement Christy's suggestion of removing the callback function before we export it: 
* ```  # Save trained model
    torch.save(net, modelname)
    
    # Remove callback function
    learn.remove_cb(CSVLogger)
    
    # export model 
    learn.export(modelname)```
* worked once: 
* `Model relative filename : artifacts/07-26_wandering_10Trials_randomized:v0/data/cmd_models_fixed/classification-resnet18-pretrained-0.pkl
Model relative filename : artifacts/07-26_wandering_10Trials_randomized:v0/data/cmd_models_fixed/classification-resnet18-pretrained-1.pkl
wandb: Waiting for W&B process to finish... (success).`

* Running into an error: 
* ``` Traceback (most recent call last):

AttributeError: 'ImageWithCmdDataset' object has no attribute 'new_empty'

* Tried multiple things to solve but the most successful was removeing learn.export because by calling the export method on the Learner object, it tries to create a new DataLoader using the new_empty method.But the ImageWithCmdDataset class does not have this method, leading to the AttributeError.
* ```
    torch.save(net.state_dict(), modelname)  # Save only the model's state_dict
    
    # Remove callback function
    learn.remove_cb(CSVLogger)
* Will this work in the same way as exporting? I think that it should because it saves the trained model's parameters, and we can later load them back when we need to use the model for predictions or further training.

# Documenting img+cmd
* Link to documented img command code: https://github.com/daisy-abbott/ARCSLab-reports/blob/master/Assets/cur-imgcmd001.py
* Need more at top? Fine that it's below imports?

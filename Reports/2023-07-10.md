# Articles
iGibson 2.0
* write a 1 to 5 sentence summary of the article: 
iGibson 2.0 uses 3 main functionalities to mitigate the gap between simulation and reality. The first being manipulation of temperature, wetness level, and cleanliness levels of objects. Second, iGibson implements predicate logic to perform a variety of functionalities such as toggledOn or onTopOf in addition to generating potentially infinite tasks to populate the environment. Third, iGibson utilizes VR to help agents learn household tasks. iGibson is evaluated with tasks that involve testing the system's ability to handle kinematic states, liquid systems, cleanliness, temperature, slicing objects, and bimanual interactions. 

Here are some thoughts to keep in mind while reading
* How does this paper relate to our lab’s work?
    * We are also creating simulation environmetns and traning robots to perform tasks, but our datasets consist of less dynamic simulation environments. 
* What techniques should we apply to our work?
    * Creating the most realistic simulation environment possible: Complying to constraints of physics, interactions etc. 
    * The deterministic approach to replay and log data. 
    * Reinforcement Learning Algorithms
    * Imitation learning? 
* What could the authors have done better?
    * Slight clarity on slicing: The slicing can only be sliced into two halfs. Why can't we reset the process and do it recursively until it's the desired size?  
    * In Evaluation, for the 15% and 0% success rate, they could have talked more about possible solutions they considered and why they decided not to pursue them or if they will. What other methods did they already try? 
    * I might have added in a one sentence summary of what they're exactly trying to solve next. 
    * They didn't mention bias. If it could have a factor or if it was, or if it wasn't relevant to this, which would still be relevent to the research. 

Sections: 

* 1: Introduction
    * iGibson 2.0 takes simulation to the next level by incorporating the ability to change the temperature of objects, their dirtiness, and wetness levels.
    * iGibson maintains and updates new extended physical states to include not only pose motion and forces but also Temp, Dirtiness, wetness, toggled and sliced states (functional states). 
    * Includes a set of logical predicates that can be evaluated with a single object (cooked) or pair of objects (InsideOf). 
    * iGibson provides: 
    1) A set of new physical properties, e.g. temperature, wetness and cleanliness level, maintained and updated by the simulator; and a set of unary and binary logical predicates that map simulated statesto a logical state that have a direct connection to semantics and language. 
    2) A set of generative functions associated with the logical predicates to sample valid simulated states rom a given logical state, and a new rule-based mechanism exploiting these functions to populate the iGibson scenes with small objects placed at semantically meaningful locations to increase realism. 
    3) A novel virtual reality interface that allows humans to collect demonstrations for robot learning.
* 2: Related Work
    * So far, related simulations have been unable to manipulate or replicate changes in kinematic states (rigid or flexible)
    * Unlike other simulations that change pre defined values to post ones (straight from raw to cooked) iGibson providse a simple simulation of the underlying
    physical process (e.g. heat transfer) leading to continuously varying values of temperature and other extended states. 
    * In terms of VR to train models, iGibson adds features such as gaze tracking and assistive grasping. 
* 3: Extended Physical States for Simulation of Everyday Household Tasks
    * types of heat source/sink: source/sinks that change the temperature of objects if they are proximal enough (e.g., a stove) and ource/sinks that change the temperature of objects if they are inside of them (e.g., a fridge or an oven).
    * he temperature of the object at each step is updated by T0^t+1 = T0^t(1 + ∆sim × r × (T − T0^t))  where ∆sim is the simulated time. 
    * Also maintains max value temp has been in the past, so if you cook a fish and burn it and then it cools down, it stays burnt. 
    * Wetness level: number of droplets that have been absorbed by the object.  
    * Difference between dust and stains is how they are cleaned. 
    * Objects are toggledOn/Off through a togglingLink that needs to be touched by the agent. 
    * Objects where sliceable == true can be sliced into two halves. 
* 4: Logical Representation of Physical States: 
    * logic predicate allow iGibson 2.0 to map a physical simulated state into an corresponding logical state
* 4.1 Generative System based on logical predicates:
    * Each kinematic predicate is implemented differently,
    combining mechanisms that include ray-casting and analytical methods to verify the validity of sampled pose.
    *Inside(A, B), we implement a procedure that generates 6D poses inside of object B and we evaluate that 1) a bounding box of the the size of object A does not penetrate object B and rays cast from A intersect object B from evaluated by casting rays from the the internal box.

* 4.2: iGibson 2.0 Scenes with Realistic Object Distribution Created by Generative System
    * To create a more realistic environment, 2.0 populates it using predicate logic. The users only need to specify list of logical predicates that represent a realistic distribution of objects in a house. 

* 5 Virtual Reality Interface
    * For the VR aspects, humans embody avatar figures, and are placed into the same scenes as the AIs. Controlled by headset and two controllers. Grasping is proven to be a bit dificult, and the current 
* Evaluation: 
    * 6 different tasks to evaluate: 
    1) kinematic logical states: grasp a book OnTopOf a table and lift it. 
    2) liquid/droplets system: Agent soaks towel
    3) cleanliness level of object: clean stained shelf
    4) Temperature: Cooking meat
    5) Slicing state: agent slices fruit
    6) Bimanual Interaction: Agent lifts heavy cauldron from OnTopOf table. Demonstrates interaction with mass.

* UE5OSC Link to repo: https://github.com/arcslaboratory/ue5osc
    * Checked mac images with Anjali and Francisco: 
    * images are now saving correctly with the following additions: 
        * call osc_communicator.save_image() in demo.py inside the OSC.communicator() function
        * pass the path through terminal: (base) daisyabbott@MacBook-Pro-307 ue5osc % python demo.py 
        /Users/daisyabbott/Desktop/images

iGibson 2.0
write a 1 to 5 sentence summary of the article
Here are some thoughts to keep in mind while reading
How does this paper relate to our labâ€™s work?
What techniques should we apply to our work?
What could the authors have done better?

Summary of Abstract: 
Because the use of virtual simulation environments are limited to motion and physical contact, they have turned to Gibson 2.0 which supports temperature, wetness level, cleanliness level, and toggled and sliced states, necessary to cover a wider range of tasks. Secondly, 2.0 supports predicate logic and can identify the validity of a given state in addition to generating potentially infinite tasks to populate the environment. Futhermore, 2.0 supports VR, to allow semantic human interaction. 

2.0 uses temp, wetness level, and predicate logic to lessen the reality gap and make perception closer to actuality. 

Questions: 
what are toggled and sliced states in relation to computer vision? 

page 2, deterministicallay a posteriori ?

a set of unary and binary logical predicates that map simulated states
to a logical state that have a direct connection to semantics and language,

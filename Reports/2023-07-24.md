# Activities
* Switching to one of Server's GPU's
    * Currently not using any of them and instead running on local machine which is probably causing the error.

    * Unsure of commands to select a GPU remotely 
    * google searches didn't have great results

* Naming Conventions for Artifacts: 
    * (<img width="878" alt="Screenshot 2023-07-24 at 2 31 24 PM" src="https://github.com/daisy-abbott/ARCSLab-reports/assets/112681549/0c0103d8-cec3-42ea-8507-4c3378c9b866">
    * When setting up the artifact, specfy in the project = env_visibility_path. env = random/ nonrandom, visibility = (true of false for robot view, in data collection should always be false), path = wandering or perfect.

    * Set the type to be "dataset" and the name to be: the date _ the number of trials _ the number of images

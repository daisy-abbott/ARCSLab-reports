| 7/24   | Met w Group to discuss plans, met w Chau and Ella to try to switch GPU, familiarized naming conventions for artifacts, looked at other commands for server GPU.  
| 7/25   | Met with Chau and Ella for img+cmd, met with Group, switched GPUs, assigned GPU's, continued on img+cmd
| 7/26   | Met with Chau & Ella, implemented arg parser, uploaded models to wandb as artifacts, met with Anjali & Francsico as large group to discuss progress. 
| 7/27   | PLAN: Meet w Chau & Ella,

# Activities
* Switching to one of Server's GPU's
    * Currently not using any of them and instead running on local machine which is probably causing the error.

    * Unsure of commands to select a GPU remotely 
    * google searches didn't have great results
    * using this command in file:  torch.cuda.set_device(2) we were able to see the machine using the properly selected GPU

    * This additionally solved our memory error and we were able to train and get results with high accuracy.

* Naming Conventions for Artifacts: 
    * (<img width="878" alt="Screenshot 2023-07-24 at 2 31 24 PM" src="https://github.com/daisy-abbott/ARCSLab-reports/assets/112681549/0c0103d8-cec3-42ea-8507-4c3378c9b866">
    * When setting up the artifact, specfy in the project = env_visibility_path. env = random/ nonrandom, visibility = (true of false for robot view, in data collection should always be false), path = wandering or perfect. 
    * <img width="729" alt="Screenshot 2023-07-24 at 2 38 56 PM" src="https://github.com/daisy-abbott/ARCSLab-reports/assets/112681549/22b9ee49-28bf-453d-b77c-f61c20c721b8">
    * Set the type to be "dataset" and the name to be: the date _ the number of trials _ the number of images
* Working with image + command: 
    * Link to current downloaded notebook: https://github.com/daisy-abbott/ARCSLab-reports/blob/master/Assets/new-imgcmd.ipynb
    * image of terminal

    * wandb usage charts from this run

    * New version of img+ command: https://github.com/daisy-abbott/ARCSLab-reports/blob/master/Assets/new-imgcmd1.ipynb
    * Chau's version of image + command: https://github.com/chauvuha/ARCS_Lab_Reports/blob/master/reports/2023-07-31/CmdImageClassification-test-largedataset.ipynb
    * Added arg parser to pass GPU in as an argument:

    * Added artifact run so that arcslaboratory wandb has two models that Francisco & Anjali can use in inference.py

# Activities

* Installed VPN and connected to HPC
    * created port 9086
    * finished set up with jupyter and activated fastai
* Started fastai course 
    * saw examples of models that:
        * recognized whether or not an image was of a bird
        * classified an image as dog or cat 
        * classified an image as teddy, grizzly, or black bear 
    * saw examples of connecting hugging face to git and creating an application in vscode that took the learner model and applied it to the new program. 
    * started learning the basics of DataLoaders and that it's a class that passes the data to the fastai model and what is needed for creation: 
        * what kinds of data we are working with
        * how to get the list of items
        * how to label these items
        * how to create the validation set
* Started learning about unreal engine
    * watched tutorial 
    * met with Anjali, Chau, and Francisco, and learneed more about the process from Anjali. 





# Issues

When trying to run the models in jupyter notebook, (on my personal mac) I ran into several issues: 
*  The kernal kept dying, and when googling the error, it said that I could either have out of date software, there's an inifinite loop, 
    or a variety of other issues. I could try to run on HPC, but don't want to put unecessary experimentation files. 
* syntaxError: invalid non-printable character U+200B
* The MPS backend is supported on MacOS 12.3+.Current OS version can be queried using `sw_vers` but this worked on collab. Also, I tried asking chat gpt and it suggested that i use torch.

# Plans

* Update my software
* Try to help with UE 
* Continue learning about training models
* Continue experimenting with notebook

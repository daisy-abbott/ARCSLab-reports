# Summary 
| Date   | Notes
| :----- | :-------------------------------
| 6/12   | Read through Christy's answers to our questions, continued exploration with different models
| 6/13   | Fastai tutorial foundation of neural networks
| 6/14   | Group meeting, re-organzied github, started command + immage
| 6/15   | Continued Command + Image
| 6/16   | Met with Chau and started working on Sweet Home Oldenborg Design

# Activities 
* Fastai: Foundations of Neural Nets
    * data normalization 
    * fitting a function with gradient descent
        * The function: Multiplies each input by a number of values. These values are known as parameters. It then adds them up for each group of values, and replaces the negative numbers with zeros.
        * This represents one layer. 
    * Automating gradient descent

* Experimented with image + command: https://github.com/daisy-abbott/ARCSLab-reports/blob/master/image-command.ipynb

* Sweet Home
    * can import images from Plan 
    * super easy to use, had to restart and scale big enough

# Issues

* Issue running the test notebook for image + command:

# Plans

* Finish Oldenborg design using Sweet Home and hopefully export it so that it can be imported into Unreal

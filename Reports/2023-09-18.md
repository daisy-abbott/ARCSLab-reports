    * In the past, under files we would see the two (one replicate) models but now we are seeing .txt .json. 
# Issues: 
* I think there may be a cuda and torch error. I saw from the documentation that these are the necessary installations for windows: 
    * conda create --name oldenborg
    * mamba install pytorch==1.13.1 torchvision==0.14.1 torchaudio==0.13.1 cpuonly -c pytorch
    * mamba install fastai

* I need to do something similar on mac because this pops up in terminal:

* Can I add documentation to training.py directly in github or should I create a pull request?
